The **Massachusetts Buildings Dataset** comprises 151 aerial images of the Boston area, each with a resolution of 1500 Ã— 1500 pixels, covering an area of approximately 2.25 square kilometers. This results in a dataset that encompasses roughly 340 square kilometers in total. To create subsets, the data was divided into a *train* set with 137 images, a *test* set with 10 images, and a *val* set with 4 images. The target maps were generated by converting building footprints obtained from the OpenStreetMap project into rasterized forms. Unlike the GTA Buildings dataset used elsewhere in the thesis, this dataset was confined to regions with an average omission noise level of approximately 5% or less. The large volume of high-quality building footprint data was collected because the City of Boston contributed building footprints for the entire city to the OpenStreetMap project. The dataset predominantly represents urban and suburban areas and includes buildings of all sizes, from individual houses to garages.

<span style="font-size: smaller; font-style: italic;">Figures (a) and (b) show two representative regions from the Massachusetts Buildings dataset. Figures (c) and (d) show predictions of a postprocessing network on these regions. Green pixels are true positives, red pixels are false positives, blue pixels are false negatives, and background pixels are true negatives.</span>
