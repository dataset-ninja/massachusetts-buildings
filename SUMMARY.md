**Massachusetts Buildings Dataset** is a dataset for instance segmentation, semantic segmentation, and object detection tasks. Possible applications of the dataset could be in the geospatial domain and environmental industry. 

The dataset consists of 151 images with 211791 labeled objects belonging to 1 single class (*building*).

Images in the Massachusetts Buildings Dataset dataset have pixel-level instance segmentation annotations. Due to the nature of the instance segmentation task, it can be automatically transformed into a semantic segmentation (only one mask for every class) or object detection (bounding boxes for every object) tasks. All images are labeled (i.e. with annotations). There are 3 splits in the dataset: *train* (137 images), *test* (10 images), and *val* (4 images). The dataset was released in 2013 by the University of Toronto.
